		that's why you want to show them as often as possible
		individuals and interactions over processes and tools

		responding to change over following a plan
	product backlog, sprint backlog
		product backlog
			maintained by product owner
			consists of features, bug fixes, non-functional requirements, etc.
			often (but not always) stated in story points, using the rounded Fibonacci scale
			"story point" unit could be defined as an hour, a day, etc.

			What did I finish?
		what will be done by the next meeting
			What am I going to do?
		blockers
			What is preventing me/us from meeting our sprint goal?
		sprint review/demo day
			not necessarily showing code, but what it does
	Trello
