  predictability ensured through inspection & adaptation
  components

        less for shorter Sprints
      set Sprint Goal

    Review
    Retrospective
  no changes during Sprint which endanger Goal
  quality goals do not decrease
  scope may be renogiated between Product Owner & Team
  Product Owner may cancel Sprint if Goal becomes obsolete
    rarely makes sense due to Sprints' short duration
    undesirable, wasteful, and traumatic to Dev Team
